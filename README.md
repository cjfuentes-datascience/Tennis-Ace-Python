“Game, Set, Match!”

No three words are sweeter to hear as a tennis player than those, which indicate that a player has beaten their opponent. While we can head down to our nearest court and aim to overcome our challenger across the net without much practice, a league of professionals spends day and night, month after month practicing to be among the best in the world. Today we  will put our linear regression knowledge to the test to better understand what it takes to be an all-star tennis player.

We will create a linear regression model that predicts the outcome for a tennis player based on their playing habits. By analyzing and modeling the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) data, we will determine what it takes to be one of the best tennis players in the world.
